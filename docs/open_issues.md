# Open Issues

A human-triageable backlog of known-but-deferred issues: latent bugs, quality gaps, and
scoped-out work that we've consciously decided *not* to fix yet. Distinct from auto-memory
(which holds trigger-first gotchas that ambush an agent editing the relevant code) — this file
is the browsable list of "things we know are wrong and might fix later."

Each entry: what's wrong, why it's deferred, where it lives, and a concrete repro if we have one.

## OI-1 — Single-answer puzzle categories score by solver-score, not by pattern (score-tie ≠ pattern-tie)

**Status**: deferred (out of scope for spec 044; explicitly untouched per FR-014/FR-015b)
**Area**: client-side puzzle scoring — `src/screens/ChallengeScreen.jsx`, `server/moveQualityScorer.js` (`scoreMove`)
**Discovered**: spec 044 QA (2026-07-11)

For the single-answer categories (`z_threat`, `overcut`, `claimeven`, `undercut`, `figure_7`,
`j_shape`), the Challenge screen judges correctness purely by the solver-score verdict
(`quality === 'optimal'`), **not** by whether the played column matches the taught pattern. Spec
044's multi-solution fix deliberately routes only `immediate_threat`/`forced_block`/`double_threat`
through the `accepted`-set path (`/api/evaluate-move` returns `accepted: null` for every other
category), so this behavior is unchanged and correct *for that feature's scope* — but the
underlying quality gap remains:

- On a board where several columns share the max solver score, a column that is **not** the taught
  pattern can read as "correct." Repro: `z_threat` board `3333302444422222060315555054`, playing
  col 0 reads correct despite not being the z-threat answer.
- On a board where the stored pattern answer is a *slower* win than another column, the **canonical
  answer itself** reads "Suboptimal." Repro: `z_threat` board `3333334512266550121166`,
  `correct_col` 0 has a below-max solver score.

**Why deferred**: fixing this means judging single-answer categories by pattern membership (like the
multi-solution categories now do via `evaluatePredicate`), which is a larger correctness-model change
than spec 044 took on. FR-014/FR-015b intentionally fenced it off.

**If picked up**: extend the `evaluatePredicate`-gated `accepted` path (or an analogous
pattern-membership check) to the single-answer categories, replacing the bare `scoreMove`
`quality==='optimal'` judgment on `ChallengeScreen.jsx`. Related memory:
`project_puzzle_correctness_seams.md` (ChallengeScreen bypasses via scoreMove).

## OI-2 — `/api/stripe/portal` silently broken: `loadUser` never selects `stripe_customer_id`

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in spec `045` (T034, 2026-07-11) — `loadUser` now selects `stripe_customer_id` on all three code paths via shared `USER_PROFILE_SELECT_COLUMNS`/`defaultUserProfile()` in `connect-four/server/userHelpers.js`; regression test in `userHelpers.test.mjs`.
**Original status**: latent bug; scheduled for fix under spec `045-account-session-checkout` (US5.4 / R3)
**Area**: `connect-four/server/index.js` — `loadUser` middleware + `POST /api/stripe/portal`
**Discovered**: Epic 5 planning audit (2026-07-11)

`loadUser` populates `req.user` but does not `select` `stripe_customer_id`, so
`req.user.stripe_customer_id` is always `undefined`. The customer-portal route depends on it, so the
portal has been broken since inception (no user has exercised it — Stripe was never live). Spec 045
fixes it because `getSubscriptionStatus`/portal need the column.

**If picked up independently of 045**: add `stripe_customer_id` to `loadUser`'s select; verify the
portal route reads it.

---

## OI-3 — Stripe webhook double-fires analytics on duplicate delivery (no idempotency short-circuit)

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in spec `045` (T033, 2026-07-11) — `handleWebhook` now checks the `stripe_events` insert result and short-circuits on `23505` (returns `{handled:false, eventType:'duplicate'}`), skipping the tier write and `upgrade_completed` track. Regression tests in `stripeProcessor.test.mjs`.
**Original status**: latent bug; scheduled for fix under spec `045` (US4 / R2)
**Area**: `connect-four/server/index.js` — `POST /api/stripe/webhook`
**Discovered**: Epic 5 planning audit (2026-07-11)

The webhook has a unique `stripe_events.stripe_event_id` but no early idempotency check, so a
duplicate Stripe delivery re-runs the handler and double-inserts the `upgrade_completed` analytics
track (the unique constraint stops the second `stripe_events` row, not the analytics side-effect).
Spec 045 adds a short-circuit-on-already-seen-event guard.

---

## OI-4 — Stripe webhook treats `customer.subscription.updated` as always → paid

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED in spec `045` (T033a, 2026-07-11) — `handleWebhook` now derives `tier` from the subscription `status`: active/trialing→paid, past_due→no write, canceled/unpaid→free, `subscription.deleted`→free. `users.tier` is a live mirror of Stripe status. Regression tests in `stripeProcessor.test.mjs`.
**Original status**: latent correctness bug; fixed under spec `045` (FR-025 / R2a) as part of the tier-mirror requirement
**Area**: `connect-four/server/index.js` — `POST /api/stripe/webhook`
**Discovered**: Epic 5 planning audit (2026-07-11)

The webhook unconditionally sets `users.tier = 'paid'` on `customer.subscription.updated`, regardless
of the subscription's actual status. Under the spec-045 requirement that `tier` be a live mirror of
Stripe, this is wrong: an `.updated` carrying `past_due`/`canceled`/`unpaid` would keep a user wrongly
paid. Fix (spec 045): derive tier from the subscription status — active/trialing→paid,
canceled/unpaid→free, `past_due`→leave unchanged (downgrade only on final termination). Related
memory: `reference_tier_source`, `project_auth_payments_state`.

## OI-5 — FR-002a "no refresh-token rotation" finding verified only against anonymous sessions

**Status**: ⏳ probe-ready (2026-07-12) — a runnable re-verification harness now exists at `connect-four/scripts/probe-refresh-rotation.mjs`; the actual run is **owner-gated** (needs a real test account's email/password, unavailable headlessly). Run: `cd connect-four && node --env-file=server/.env scripts/probe-refresh-rotation.mjs <email> <password>`. If it prints "rotation detected", build the de-dup Map (plan Task F2) and update `server-conventions.md`; if "no rotation", close OI-5. Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-open-issues-remediation.md` Theme F.
**Area**: `connect-four/server/authRefresh.js` (no de-dup Map), `GET /api/auth/session` silent refresh
**Discovered**: spec `045` T002 (2026-07-11)

The FR-002a empirical check (spec 045 T002, recorded in `specs/045-account-session-checkout/research.md` R1) concluded this project's Supabase/GoTrue does **not** enforce rotation-with-reuse-detection — a superseded refresh token still works — so **no single-flight de-dup was built** in `attemptRefresh`. That check was run only against `signInAnonymously()` sessions; a real email/OAuth session was not available in the test environment. Rotation policy is a GoTrue project-level setting (not grant-type-specific), so this is very likely fine — but if Supabase's refresh-rotation setting is ever enabled, two concurrent same-token `/api/auth/refresh` calls (two tabs whose access tokens expire in the same tick) could spuriously sign a user out. `docs/architecture/server-conventions.md` documents the absence deliberately so it isn't "re-added" blindly.

**Why deferred**: the shipped behavior is correct for the observed GoTrue config; building a de-dup Map now would be unmotivated machinery (Principle II).
**If picked up**: re-run T002's two-concurrent-refresh probe against a real email/OAuth session (not anonymous); if the second call fails with `refresh_token_already_used`, build the TTL-bounded single-flight de-dup Map in `authRefresh.js` per research.md R1's design, and update the server-conventions.md note. Also worth pairing with the FR-008 staging check (Supabase dashboard session-timeout config).

## OI-6 — Superseded de-dup language in `contracts/api-auth-session.md`

**Status**: deferred (doc staleness, non-functional)
**Area**: `specs/045-account-session-checkout/contracts/api-auth-session.md`
**Discovered**: spec `045` T041/T042 (2026-07-11)

The auth-session contract still describes a server-side de-dup Map coalescing concurrent same-token refreshes, which the shipped code deliberately does **not** implement (see OI-5 / research.md R1). The authoritative, current behavior is documented in `docs/architecture/api-conventions.md` and `server-conventions.md`; the contract file's original wording is now superseded.

**Why deferred**: cosmetic — the contract is a frozen planning artifact; the architecture docs are the live source of truth.
**If picked up**: add a one-line "SUPERSEDED — see OI-5 / server-conventions.md" note at the top of the relevant section in `contracts/api-auth-session.md`.

---

## OI-7 — No DOM/browser test harness exists in this repo

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-12 — React Testing Library + jsdom adopted under `npm run test:dom`; documented in testing-conventions.md
**Area**: project-wide test infrastructure — `connect-four/tests/`, `testing-conventions.md`
**Discovered**: spec `046` plan review (2026-07-11), while resolving the FR-024/SC-007 board-flicker
regression-check design

This project has `node:test`-based unit tests for pure server/frontend logic (per
`testing-conventions.md`'s Pure Function Extraction Pattern) but no React Testing Library, jsdom, Playwright,
or equivalent component/DOM-level test harness. Any regression check that would naturally want to assert on
rendered DOM/component behavior (e.g. "does this component re-render/remount under state X") instead has to
be satisfied by extracting the relevant logic into a pure, non-DOM function and unit-testing that — which
works, but is a workaround, not a substitute for real component testing when the defect is genuinely about
render/remount behavior rather than pure computation.

**Why deferred**: no single feature has needed DOM testing badly enough to justify introducing new test
infra (a real cost: new dependency, CI wiring, maintenance surface) — spec 046's board-flicker check (FR-024/
SC-007) was resolvable via the pure-function-extraction workaround, so it did not force the issue. The owner
acknowledges a DOM/browser harness would be valuable but this is a standing gap, not a blocker.

**If picked up**: evaluate React Testing Library (jsdom-based, no browser needed, lightest-weight fit for
this stack) vs. leaning further on the existing `chrome-devtools-mcp`/`app-qa` skill for real-browser manual/
agentic QA; either way, document the choice in `testing-conventions.md` once adopted.

## OI-8 — RESOLVED: board "flicker" was a layout reflow on ChallengeScreen (US5 root cause corrected)

**Status**: resolved 2026-07-11 (real root cause found + fixed; Batch-4 memoization retained as harmless perf hardening)
**Area**: `connect-four/src/screens/ChallengeScreen.jsx` (fix site), `src/components/CoachDialog.jsx` (`fixed` reserved-height mode)

**Discovered**: spec `046` US5 implementation (2026-07-11); **corrected same day** via
`/scientific-method-debugging` with an owner-supplied live repro.

The originally-shipped US5 work (Batch 4) misdiagnosed the defect: it memoized `Board`
(`memo(BoardImpl, boardPropsAreEqual)` + `deriveBoardSignature`, backed by
`tests/unit/boardMemoStability.test.js`) on the theory that already-placed discs were re-rendering. That
was **not** the bug. The owner clarified the real symptom — "in practice 1 of immediate threat, after the
disc is placed a new coach message bubble appears and the board **moves down**" — and it reproduces on the
**ChallengeScreen** (`/clchallenge/…`, "Immediate Threats — Practice"), not Concept/Socratic.

**Confirmed root cause (browser-measured):** ChallengeScreen's outer container is a `flex column` rendering
`<CoachDialog messages={coachMessages} …>` directly above the board. `coachMessages` **accumulates** (the
post-move feedback bubble is appended below the prompt bubble), so the coach region grows in height and the
board — the next flow sibling — reflows downward. Measured: placing the winning disc appended a 2nd bubble,
the coach region grew ~99px→136px, and the board top moved 195→232 (**down 37px**). Nothing about disc
rendering was involved. Concept/Socratic stayed put only because they *replace* their single coach message
rather than accumulate.

**Fix:** pass the existing `fixed` prop — `<CoachDialog fixed messages={coachMessages} size={58} />` — which
reserves a stable `height:140` (inner `maxHeight:120, overflowY:auto`), so appended bubbles scroll within the
region instead of growing it. This matches the pre-existing `GameScreen.jsx`/`ReviewScreen.jsx` pattern for
accumulating coach messages over an interactive board. Verified in-browser: board top now **236 before and
236 after** the move (0px shift); coach region held 140px; both bubbles + win highlight render correctly.

**Regression check (FR-024 — documented manual procedure, per OI-7 no-DOM-harness):** on
`/clchallenge/immediate-threat`, measure the board container's `getBoundingClientRect().top` before and after
placing the winning disc (which appends a feedback bubble); the two values must be equal. The Batch-4
`boardMemoStability.test.js` remains green and is kept (referential stability is still a valid, if unrelated,
property). Cross-ref: spec 046 US5, [[OI-7]] (no DOM harness).

## OI-9 — Only `immediate-threat` has generated narration audio; 12 lessons still silent

**Status**: deferred (content-population step, not a bug — scoped out of spec 046 verification)
**Area**: `connect-four/lessons/*.json` (`coachMessages[].audio`), `connect-four/public/audio/lessons/`

**Discovered**: spec `046` T030 verification (2026-07-11)

Spec 046 shipped the lesson-narration generation/playback machinery and verified it end-to-end by
generating audio for **one** lesson (`immediate-threat`: 4 clips, committed). The other 12 lessons have no
`coachMessages[].audio` populated, so their concept slides display silently (graceful per FR-017, but no
narration). This is a content step, not a defect.

**Why deferred**: generation is a per-lesson admin action with real OpenAI TTS cost; the owner decides which
lessons get audio and when. Verifying the mechanism on one lesson was sufficient for the epic.

**If picked up**: for each remaining lesson, run the localhost admin "Generate audios" action (editor button,
or `POST /api/admin/lessons/:id/generate-audio`), then `git add` the new `public/audio/lessons/*.mp3` + the
updated lesson JSON and redeploy (per FR-012a, generation never runs in prod). Real key is in
`connect-four/server/.env` ([[feedback_openai_key_present]]). Cross-ref: spec 046 US3/US4.

## OI-10 — Frontend Sentry is imported but never initialized (error reporting is a silent no-op)

**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED 2026-07-12 — `Sentry.init()` added in `connect-four/src/main.jsx`, gated on
`import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (mirrors the server's existing `SENTRY_DSN` gate). `.env.example`
documents the new frontend DSN var. CSP `connect-src` (`connect-four/server/index.js`) now allows the
Sentry ingest host via an env-derived `SENTRY_INGEST` (`process.env.SENTRY_INGEST_HOST` or a
`*.ingest.sentry.io` wildcard default). The CSP smoke-test error-reporting leg dropped by spec 047 FR-005
has been re-added in `staging_checks.md`. **Deploy prerequisite**: `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` must be set in the
frontend build env and `SENTRY_DSN` in the server env for either side to actually report; both remain
no-ops (safe defaults) if unset.

**Area**: `connect-four/src/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`, `connect-four/src/main.jsx`;
`connect-four/server/index.js` (CSP `connect-src`); `connect-four/.env.example` (`SENTRY_DSN`,
`VITE_SENTRY_DSN`)

**Discovered**: spec `047` (Epic 7) plan verification (2026-07-12)

**Original gap** (historical, now fixed): `ErrorBoundary.jsx` imports `@sentry/react` and calls
`Sentry.captureException(error, { extra: info })`, but there was **no `Sentry.init()` anywhere in `src/`**
and no frontend DSN env var — so the SDK was uninitialized and `captureException` was a no-op. Frontend
errors were silently dropped. Server-side Sentry is separately gated on `SENTRY_DSN` (`index.js`,
`logger.js`), which is documented (commented out by default) in `.env.example`; its live-deploy
configuration is unconfirmed and out of scope for this fix.

**Consequence for spec 047 (historical)**: this is why FR-005's CSP smoke test **dropped** the "error
events still reach the reporting service" leg (marked N/A — nothing to break), and why the CSP had **no**
Sentry `connect-src` entry (no browser-side Sentry traffic existed to allow). Spec 047 US2 task T012 filed
the formal backlog note for the frontend gap — this entry is that backlog item, now resolved.

**Resolution**: `Sentry.init()` now runs in `src/main.jsx` gated on `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`; the CSP `connect-src`
now allows the Sentry ingest host (`SENTRY_INGEST` in `server/index.js`); the CSP smoke-test error-reporting
leg is re-added in `staging_checks.md`. Remaining work is operational, not code: provision a real
`VITE_SENTRY_DSN` (frontend) and confirm `SENTRY_DSN` (server) in the deploy env, then run the re-added
staging smoke-test leg.

## OI-11 — Admin gate has no second factor beyond `requireLocalhost` (FR-009 deferred scope)

**Status**: ✅ CLOSED — won't-fix (accepted risk, owner-confirmed 2026-07-12). The header-spoof hardening (FR-009, `req.socket.remoteAddress`) is delivered; adding a mandatory authenticated admin session on top of `requireLocalhost` remains deliberately out of scope. Reopen only if the threat model changes (e.g. shared-host / SSH-forward exposure becomes real).
**Area**: `connect-four/server/index.js` — all `/api/admin/*` and `/api/debug/*` routes gated by `requireLocalhost`

**Discovered**: spec `047` (Epic 7) US3 implementation (2026-07-12)

Spec 047 US3 (T015) consolidated the debug endpoint's duplicated inline localhost check onto the shared
`requireLocalhost` middleware. **Correction (spec-047 QA, 2026-07-12):** the original planning assumption —
that `trust proxy = 1` made `req.ip` unspoofable — was WRONG. With `trust proxy = 1` (needed for
`express-rate-limit`), Express derives `req.ip` FROM the client-supplied `X-Forwarded-For` header for one
hop, so a direct (non-proxied) caller sending `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` from a non-loopback address
passed the gate (reproduced live). This was fixed by changing `requireLocalhost` to check
`req.socket.remoteAddress` (the raw TCP peer, header-immune) instead of `req.ip`. That now genuinely
hardens the gate against header-spoofing (FR-009 delivered), but the gate itself remains **localhost-only,
with no authenticated admin session as a second factor**. Anyone who can reach the app process on
`127.0.0.1` (e.g. via SSH port-forward or a compromised sibling process on the same host/container) has
full admin access with no login check.

**Why deferred**: FR-009 only required the gate be unspoofable by a forged header, which T015 delivers. Adding
a mandatory authenticated admin session on top of `requireLocalhost` is a separate, larger change (session
plumbing, an admin-role check, likely reusing `requireAdmin`'s `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist alongside the localhost
gate rather than instead of it) and was explicitly out of scope for this feature.

**If picked up**: require both `requireLocalhost` AND an authenticated session whose user is in `ADMIN_EMAILS`
(see `server/adminAuth.js`'s `requireAdmin`, already used as a second gate on the `/api/admin/*` routes at
`docs/architecture` review time — audit whether every admin/debug route already stacks `requireAdmin` alongside
`requireLocalhost`, since `/api/debug/classify-all` and some `/api/admin/candidates*` routes currently do not).

## OI-12 — Deep-reveal first (uncached) load can time out client-side before the LLM returns

**Status**: deferred (pre-existing; surfaced during spec-047 QA, unrelated to this feature's changes)
**Area**: `connect-four/src/components/DeepRevealPane.jsx` — client-side fetch timeout
**Discovered**: spec `047` (Epic 7) QA (2026-07-12)

`DeepRevealPane.jsx` uses a fixed ~6-second client-side timeout on the deep-reveal explanation fetch. A
genuine *uncached* `POST /api/explain-move-llm` call to the OpenAI reasoning model can take longer than 6s
to return, so the UI shows "Detailed explanation unavailable." even though the call actually succeeds
server-side (confirmed during QA: the underlying response was valid and the `llm_usage` telemetry row was
written correctly). A second (now-cached) request for the same position rendered in <1s. This predates spec
047 (the file is untouched by this feature — confirmed via `git diff`) and is not caused by the telemetry
wrapper (the ledger write is fire-and-forget and does not add latency).

**Why deferred**: out of scope for spec 047 (a hardening/observability feature); it's a UX-latency issue in
an unrelated component. Only reliably reproduces on a cold/uncached reasoning-model call.

**If picked up**: raise or remove the fixed 6s client timeout in `DeepRevealPane.jsx` (reasoning-model calls
are legitimately slow on first load), or show a "still thinking…" state instead of a failure message when the
timeout elapses while the request is still in flight. Verify against a cold call in staging (cache TRUNCATEd
on deploy per `project_spec039_audio_interactive_coach`, so the first post-deploy call is always uncached).

## OI-13 — Onboarding "import offer shown once" marker is per-browser (localStorage), not per-account

**Status**: ✅ CLOSED — accepted design limitation (owner-confirmed 2026-07-12). The `onboarding_offer_shown_v1` localStorage marker stays per-browser; a benign always-dismissible import offer re-showing on a new device is acceptable, and syncing it would reintroduce the server-row-for-anonymous problem the design avoids. Reopen only if the offer becomes non-dismissible or costly to re-show.
**Area**: `connect-four/src/lib/onboardingOfferMarker.js` + `OnboardingImportOfferScreen.jsx` mount (the `onboarding_offer_shown_v1` localStorage marker)
**Discovered**: spec 048 (Epic 8, onboarding) planning/review (2026-07-12)

Onboarding's post-aha "import your real games" offer must appear **exactly once** per user. The three-state
`onboarding_status` enum (`not_encountered | seen | skipped`) has no terminal "offer done" state by design
(FR-013 forbids growing server-side bookkeeping for anonymous users), so idempotency is delegated to a
device-local `localStorage` marker (`onboarding_offer_shown_v1`), written on the offer screen's mount. Because
the marker is per-browser and never synced to the account, a user who saw and dismissed the offer in one
browser, then signs in (or just opens the app) in a **different browser/device**, will see the one-time offer
again. Judged acceptable during planning (import is a benign, always-dismissible offer; syncing it would
reintroduce the server-row-for-anonymous problem the design deliberately avoids), but explicitly flagged to
re-confirm with the owner during implementation.

**Why deferred**: it's an accepted trade-off of the anonymous-first, no-anon-server-bookkeeping design, not a
bug to fix now; the feature is not yet built.

**If picked up**: decide whether "offer already shown" should become per-account (e.g. fold into the migrated
profile / a `users` column) for signed-in users, accepting the extra column + migration cost — or leave
per-browser. Cross-ref: `specs/048-onboarding-experience/{plan,research,data-model}.md`,
[[project-user-column-propagation]].

## OI-14 — Account carryover of `onboarding_status` unverified end-to-end; silently no-ops if migration 057 isn't applied

**Status**: deferred verification + deploy prerequisite (spec 048 — client side fully verified, server persistence not)
**Area**: `connect-four/server/migrations/057_users_onboarding_status.sql` (unapplied), `POST /api/user/migrate`, `GET`/`PUT /api/user/profile`
**Discovered**: spec 048 (Epic 8) QA (2026-07-12)

US1 Scenario 4 (an anonymous user's `onboarding_status` carrying over to their account on sign-up)
could not be verified end-to-end in local dev: (a) migration `057_users_onboarding_status.sql` is
file-only and was never applied, so `public.users` has no `onboarding_status` column locally, and
(b) the running dev server process predates the Epic 8 server code (no server hot-reload). The
compounding trap surfaced during QA: **PostgREST silently drops an unknown column from an UPDATE
rather than erroring**, so `POST /api/user/migrate` returns `204` with the correct
`onboarding_status` in the request body while the value is **never persisted** — a silent no-op, not
a 500. The client side (migrate-payload construction, sign-in flow, routing to the import entry
point) is fully verified; only the final DB-column persistence is unproven.

**Why deferred**: verifying it requires applying migration 057 to a DB and restarting the server —
a deploy/ops step, not a code change. The behavior is correct by construction once the column exists.

**If picked up**: apply migration 057 (see `reference_supabase_connection.md`), restart `npm run dev`,
then run `specs/048-onboarding-experience/quickstart.md`'s "account carryover" section and confirm the
account row's `onboarding_status` reflects the migrated anonymous value. This is already noted in
`staging_checks.md` under Epic 8. Cross-ref: [[project_user_column_propagation]], [[OI-13]].

## OI-15 — Spanish i18n (`es.json`) ships translations but is never registered; app is English-only

**Status**: ⏳ PARTIAL 2026-07-12 — switcher machinery SHIPPED (useLanguage hook, es bundle registered, Settings selector). REMAINING: es.json covers only 2 of 24 key-sections; full Spanish translation is a separate content effort (see Theme H / its own spec). Selecting es renders English via fallback until then.
**Area**: `connect-four/src/i18n/index.js` (`lng: 'en'`, only `en` resource registered), `connect-four/src/i18n/es.json`
**Discovered**: spec 048 (Epic 8) QA (2026-07-12)

`src/i18n/index.js` hardcodes `lng: 'en'` and registers only the `en` resource bundle; `es.json`
exists on disk (and spec 048 dutifully added `onboarding.*` keys to it) but is never wired into i18next
and there is no in-app language switcher. So every Spanish translation in the repo — including the new
onboarding copy — is dead. US4 Scenario 4 ("onboarding copy shown in the selected language") is
therefore only satisfiable in principle (all copy correctly routes through `t('onboarding.*')` keys);
it can't be exercised because language selection doesn't exist. This predates Epic 8 and affects the
whole app, not just onboarding.

**Why deferred**: wiring a language switcher + `es` resource is an app-wide i18n feature, out of scope
for the onboarding epic; nothing in spec 048 regressed it.

**If picked up**: register the `es` bundle in `src/i18n/index.js`, add a language selector (Settings is
the natural home), and verify onboarding + the rest of the app render under `es`. Keep `es.json` keys
in lockstep with `en.json` if the switcher goes live.

## OI-16 — Follow-ups from the Open-Issues Remediation branch (low-risk polish)

**Status**: deferred (accepted as backlog by the final whole-branch review, 2026-07-12; not merge-blocking)
**Area**: `connect-four/src/components/DeepRevealPane.jsx` + `src/lib/deepRevealTimeout.js`; `connect-four/package.json` (jsdom peer)
**Discovered**: final review of plan `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-12-open-issues-remediation.md`

Two small residues from remediating OI-12 and OI-7, both judged defer-not-fix:

- **Dead tested helper (from OI-12):** `deepRevealPhase(elapsedMs, resolved)` in `src/lib/deepRevealTimeout.js` is unit-tested but **not consumed** — `DeepRevealPane.jsx` drives the `slow`/`timedOut` states inline via `setTimeout`, reimplementing the same 3-way branch. Both sides import the shared `DEEP_REVEAL_SOFT_MS`/`DEEP_REVEAL_HARD_MS` constants, so the timing can't drift, only the branch shape. If picked up: either wire `deepRevealPhase` into the render, or drop the helper + its test.
- **jsdom peer mismatch (from OI-7):** `global-jsdom@29` peer-wants `jsdom >=29 <30` but `jsdom@27` resolved. npm treats this as a warning, `npm run test:dom` passes, but a future `npm ci --strict-peer-deps` (or global-jsdom major) could fail. If picked up: bump `jsdom` to `^29` and re-run `npm run test:dom`.
